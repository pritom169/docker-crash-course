## Docker vs VM
- Docker only controls the Applications layers wherease the VM also controls the Application layer with it#s own os
kernel.
- As a result the docker images are small where as VMs like virtual box are quite large in size
- On the other hand since VM directly talks with host operating sysmtem and it also talks with host hardwares also,
VMs are compatable with any OS, however that is not the case with Docker. On compatability VMs are better than docker.
